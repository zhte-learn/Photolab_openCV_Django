# Django Image Analysis with OpenCV

This is a study project built with **Django** and **OpenCV** that enables users to upload images and perform automated analysis including:
- Image quality assessment
- Face detection
- Object detection

---

## Project Overview

Users can upload images through a simple web interface. The backend processes each image using OpenCV to:

- Analyze the quality of the image (e.g., sharpness, brightness)
- Detect faces present in the image and mark them
- Detect objects using pre-trained models and highlight them
